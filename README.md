## What is dovetail cli?

Dovetail cli is a command line tool that enables smart contract generation for different blockchain technologies from the same model.

This allows definition of your smart contracts on a model driven approach and abstraction of your smart contract logic from the low level code, improving visibility, auditability and reduce errors.
